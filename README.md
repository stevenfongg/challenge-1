# challenge-1

This challenge consisted of refracting working code into something that is more streamlined and efficient. I did so by creating sections and articles for the web page elements.
By doing so, it allowed me to organize the elements far better that the original code as well as cutting down on the amount of code that was in the CSS file.
I stylized the HTML elements by sections and articles rather than styling each individual element.
There were also a few other things that I had to change such as entering a title, adding navigation to the SEO tab and adding alternate attributes for images and icons.
